/*
Sam Stillwater currently makes $53,520 per year and he would like to increase that to $60,000 so he would have some money for fun stuff.  He discovered that there is a species of frog on his property which has hair.  Not much hair, usually only 6 hairs per frog.  Heâ€™s been monitoring sales of this hair on EBay and usually each hair sells for $10.
Write an assembly program that would show Sam how many frogs he would have to capture and de-hair every month to reach his monetary goal.  Output the number of frogs required.
Data declarations and output may be in C.
